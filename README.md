## Analysis of Fast Fourier Transform and Heston Model for Option Pricing
#### This paper intends to analyze and compare European call option pricing using both the closed form Heston model and the Fast Fourier Transform method (Carr-Madan). We intend to determine when it is appropriate to use FFT methods for pricing European calls based on the efficiency of its use with a variety of calibration techniques. 
#### To test the Carr-Madan FFT, we implement a model in Python for the closed form Heston method. Then, we calibrate the parameters based on market data using two calibration methods: one that minimizes squared differences in price between the model and the market, and another that does the same with option implied volatility.
#### Next, we implement a model in Python based on the Carr-Madan FFT, calling on the characteristic function as defined by Heston stock dynamics. After calibrating this model similarly to with the closed form model, we compare the accuracy and computational efficiency of both models. While it is known that the FFT model is fast and flexible, we intend to use these results to investigate the potential errors or shortcomings of the FFT and pinpoint where and why those might arise.
